# Interpreting-human-emotional-responses-from-real-time-video-capture
The developed interface is part of the COMPANION-CM project [1], which aims to create more social assistive robots. One of the keys to achieving this goal is for these machines to be able to interpret and act in response to human responses generated by the robot's own actions. And the fact is that every human reaction involves an emotion, which is the focus of this work.
